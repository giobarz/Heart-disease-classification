# Heart-disease-classification
This project focuses on a binary classification problem concerning heart diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)â€™s 2020 annual survey, heart disease ranks among the leading causes of death across various racial groups in the US, including African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and white individuals. Approximately 47% of Americans possess at least one of three primary risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and smoking. Other significant indicators include diabetes, obesity (measured by a high BMI), lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Detecting and preventing these influential factors is of utmost importance in healthcare. The purpose of this project is to develop a prediction on the causes related to the presence or absence of heart diseases.
